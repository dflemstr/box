                    To add new applications, you have to upload them in PND files.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You just have to upload the PND file; we will take care of filling
                    in all of the details for you. After uploading the file, we will
                    extract the metadata you specify in the included <code>PXML.xml</code>
                    file. Therefore, you should try to adhere to
                    <a href="http://pandorawiki.org/PXML_specification">the PXML standard</a>
                    and include as much metadata in your PND as possible.
